## Description

 A project that stemmed from a Latin class project. Meant to allow me to drive and take pictures by just pressing a button... Dash cams existed, I don't know what I was thinking. Maybe was trying to extend it into something with a holographic display (think smart hud while snowboarding/skiing) but I don't fully remember.
