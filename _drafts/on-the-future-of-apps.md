#The Death of the App as We Know It

As the phone technology progressed, apps became the standard for deploying neatly packaged software to the end user. With the data saved locally and the size of average app constantly increasing, phone manufacturers were forced to focus on storage as a main feature of a phone. Batteries became thinner, storage became lighter -- but we've reached a standstill that calls for a different approach instead of upgraded parts. 


Mobile apps rely on bulky software being stored on the client of the phone. The focus on client side data has major benefits, but at this point I think many of the benefits have been  outgrown. One big pro to a focus on client side apps is availability. Because all of the data is stored locally, it can be accessed anywhere. During the days where phone signal was very slow and less widely available, this approach made sense. Users would need access to services during times with no signal, so naturally developers would want their apps stored locally for the user. 

This becomes an issue when the data is unneeded. For example, you will never need to use a banking app without a wireless connection, so why should it be taking up memory on our phone when we don't need it? It's unused space for a service that might not be needed frequently. This goes for many apps that don't serve a purely offline purpose. Quite simply, these apps are taking up too much space, and we have too many of them. The amount of apps we store directly on our phones adds to the problem. Many of these apps have dependencies that directly overlap, but need to be installed on a per-instance basis. So on a phone, there might be 60 apps, and only 5 of them get used daily. then maybe 40 apps that are used at some point within a week, and 15 that are very rarely used. This is a huge amount of unneeded clutter that could directly be fixed by a change of approach in software.


  Now, we've come to a point where phone users have signal in most places. In the near future, signal coverage will expand and become faster. I think that there a point will be reached where the speeds of satellite data becomes a practical solution for the majority of end-users. With 4g speeds being close to speeds of wireless data transfer, the rates are fast enough to cover most media consumption.
