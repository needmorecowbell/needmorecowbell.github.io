Inception
=======
My first guitar was a beat up acoustic American Standard that had been through many years of not-so-great care. The nut was cracked, the body was badly scratched, and vastly changing temperatures caused the guitar to warp.


When I first started driving, I had romanticized the idea of going across the country in my late great-step-grandmother's Honda 03' CRV that my family had jokingly named the "Polished Turd". I felt like just driving for the sake of exploring wasn't enough, and that I needed some sort of mission or goal for the trip... enter the QR Guitar

The Idea
========
I wanted to create a "living" guitar -- an instrument that would pick up history on it's way wherever it went, and transmit it's history to the people who saw it.

Why?
======================
In the first grade, my family gave me my first guitar.
