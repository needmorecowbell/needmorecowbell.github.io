Starting as a web developer, I first learned basic css and html. Just like anyone who started off with such humble beginnings, I found it a little disheartening when all I could get was some aligned text on a screen with a colored background. Then came bootstrap, which showed me how building on top of other people's code could make my life much easier.It still seemed very basic and static though, and I wanted to give my websites life -- Enter parallax effects.

Parallax animation is the act of putting layers of images over each other and moving them at different speeds/directionsto give the illusion of depth. This technique can be seen in many applications, although you might never have known the name of it. In this post, I'll show you different examples of these animations in use on the web and provide resources for you to learn how to use them in your code.
