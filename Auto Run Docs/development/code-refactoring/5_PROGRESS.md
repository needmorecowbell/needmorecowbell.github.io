# Refactoring Pipeline Progress Gate

## Context
- **Playbook:** Refactor
- **Agent:** blog_ui_cleanup
- **Project:** /home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io
- **Auto Run Folder:** /home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io/Auto Run Docs
- **Loop:** 00001

## Purpose

This document is the **progress gate** for the refactoring pipeline. It checks whether there are still `PENDING` refactoring items with LOW risk and HIGH/VERY HIGH benefit to implement. **This is the only document with Reset ON** - it controls loop continuation by resetting tasks in documents 1-4 when more work is needed.

## Instructions

1. **Read `/home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io/Auto Run Docs/LOOP_00001_PLAN.md`** to check for remaining work
2. **Read `/home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io/Auto Run Docs/LOOP_00001_CANDIDATES.md`** to check tactic exhaustion status
3. **Check if there are any `PENDING` items** with LOW risk AND HIGH/VERY HIGH benefit (not `IMPLEMENTED`, not `WON'T DO`, not `PENDING - MANUAL REVIEW`)
4. **If auto-implementable PENDING items exist OR tactics remain**: Reset all tasks in documents 1-4 to continue the loop
5. **If NO auto-implementable PENDING items AND all tactics exhausted**: Do NOT reset - pipeline exits

## Progress Check

- [x] **Check for remaining work**: Read LOOP_00001_PLAN.md and LOOP_00001_CANDIDATES.md. The loop should CONTINUE (reset docs 1-4) if EITHER: (1) there are items with status exactly `PENDING` that have LOW risk AND HIGH/VERY HIGH benefit, OR (2) CANDIDATES.md does NOT contain `## ALL_TACTICS_EXHAUSTED`. The loop should EXIT (do NOT reset) only when BOTH conditions are false: no auto-implementable PENDING items AND all tactics are exhausted.
  - **Completed 2026-01-06**: Checked both files. PLAN.md has 1 item (IMPLEMENTED), 0 PENDING items. CANDIDATES.md does NOT contain `ALL_TACTICS_EXHAUSTED` marker. **Decision: CONTINUE** - 6 of 7 tactics remain unexplored.

## Reset Tasks (Only if work remains)

If the progress check above determines we need to continue (auto-implementable PENDING items OR tactics remaining), reset all tasks in the following documents:

- [x] **Reset 1_ANALYZE.md**: Uncheck all tasks in `/home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io/Auto Run Docs/1_ANALYZE.md`
- [x] **Reset 2_FIND_ISSUES.md**: Uncheck all tasks in `/home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io/Auto Run Docs/2_FIND_ISSUES.md`
- [x] **Reset 3_EVALUATE.md**: Uncheck all tasks in `/home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io/Auto Run Docs/3_EVALUATE.md`
- [x] **Reset 4_IMPLEMENT.md**: Uncheck all tasks in `/home/adam/Dev/blog/needmorecowbell.github.io/Auto Run Docs/4_IMPLEMENT.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Only reset documents 1-4 if there is work remaining (auto-implementable PENDING items OR unexplored tactics). If all tactics are exhausted AND all items are IMPLEMENTED, WON'T DO, or PENDING - MANUAL REVIEW, leave these reset tasks unchecked to allow the pipeline to exit.

## Decision Logic

```
IF LOOP_00001_PLAN.md doesn't exist:
    → Do NOT reset anything (PIPELINE JUST STARTED - LET IT RUN)

ELSE IF items with status exactly `PENDING` exist with LOW risk AND HIGH/VERY HIGH benefit:
    → Reset documents 1-4 (CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT PENDING ITEMS)

ELSE IF LOOP_00001_CANDIDATES.md does NOT contain "ALL_TACTICS_EXHAUSTED":
    → Reset documents 1-4 (CONTINUE TO DISCOVER MORE CANDIDATES)

ELSE:
    → Do NOT reset anything (ALL TACTICS EXHAUSTED AND NO AUTO-IMPLEMENTABLE ITEMS - EXIT)
```

**Key insight:** The loop should continue if EITHER:
1. There are PENDING items with LOW risk AND HIGH/VERY HIGH benefit to implement, OR
2. There are still tactics to execute (no `ALL_TACTICS_EXHAUSTED` marker)

## How This Works

This document controls loop continuation through resets:
- **Reset tasks checked** → Documents 1-4 get reset → Loop continues
- **Reset tasks unchecked** → Nothing gets reset → Pipeline exits

### Exit Conditions (Do NOT Reset)

Exit when ALL of these are true:
1. **Tactics exhausted**: `LOOP_00001_CANDIDATES.md` contains `## ALL_TACTICS_EXHAUSTED`
2. **No auto-implementable PENDING items**: All LOW risk + HIGH/VERY HIGH benefit items are `IMPLEMENTED`, `WON'T DO`, or `PENDING - MANUAL REVIEW`

Also exit if:
3. **Max Loops**: Hit the loop limit in Batch Runner

### Continue Conditions (Reset Documents 1-4)

Continue if EITHER is true:
1. There are items with status exactly `PENDING` that have LOW risk AND HIGH/VERY HIGH benefit in LOOP_00001_PLAN.md
2. `LOOP_00001_CANDIDATES.md` does NOT contain `## ALL_TACTICS_EXHAUSTED` (more tactics to run)

## Current Status

Before making a decision, check both files:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **PENDING (LOW risk, HIGH+ benefit)** | 0 |
| **PENDING (other)** | 0 |
| **IMPLEMENTED** | 1 |
| **WON'T DO** | 0 |
| **PENDING - MANUAL REVIEW** | 0 |
| **ALL_TACTICS_EXHAUSTED present?** | NO |

## Progress History

Track progress across loops:

| Loop | Refactors Implemented | Items Remaining | Tactics Exhausted? | Decision |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | 1 (duplicate single.html) | 0 PENDING | NO (6/7 tactics remain) | CONTINUE |
| 2 | ___ | ___ | ___ | [CONTINUE / EXIT] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Manual Override

**To force exit early:**
- Leave all reset tasks unchecked regardless of PENDING items

**To continue despite no auto-implementable items:**
- Check the reset tasks to force another analysis pass

**To pause for manual review:**
- Leave unchecked
- Review REFACTOR_LOG and plan file
- Restart when ready

## Notes

- This playbook focuses on LOW risk refactors with HIGH or VERY HIGH benefit
- MEDIUM and HIGH risk refactors are marked for manual review
- Each loop iteration implements ONE refactor at a time for safety
- The REFACTOR_LOG tracks all changes across loops for easy review
- Always run tests after each loop to verify behavior is preserved
